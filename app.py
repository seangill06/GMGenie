                    The user wants a quest based on the following details, please use the following campaign context to help create the quest:
                    {campaign_context}

                    Here are the specific requirements:
                    - **Quest Title:**

                    - **Primary Conflict:** (the main problem)
                    - **Three-Act Structure:**
                        * **Act 1: The Hook:** How do the players get involved?
                        * **Act 2: The Rising Action:** What challenges do they face? Include a puzzle, a combat encounter, and a social challenge.
                        * **Act 3: The Climax:** What is the final confrontation?
                    - **Reward:** (e.g., gold, a magic item, a favor)
                    - **Optional: Plot Twist:** A short, unexpected reveal that can surprise the players.

                    Please generate a detailed and inspiring quest based on the requirements above. The output should be a well-formatted narrative clearly labeled with each section.
